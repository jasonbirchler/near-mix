# A Near Mix

**Common Denominator Devices 'A Near Mix' Eurorack Module.**

6 input, 2 output minimal panning mixer in 12hp.
Designed for Intellijel 1U format.

A Near Mix is an SMD variant of [Mixor Image][mixor-git], which is built upon the bones of Nearness designed by [Jesper Särnesjö][nearness-git].
Nearness is a product of the *[llllllll][nearness-lines]* community. 

# Changes

* Inputs have been rearranged. Proximity to output now implies strength of panning.
* This module has been re-designed to suit the Intellijel 1U format behind a 12hp panel.
* Resistor values have been changed throughout to give a different stereo image *(An automated method was used for this to select nearest common resistor values based on angle of placement in the stereo field for each input)*
* An additional centre input with a high pass filter has been added so as not to muddy the middle of the stereo field
* Stereo in & out *link* connectors have been added allowing for chaining of multiple modules or linking to other manufacturers' stereo modules without patch cables
